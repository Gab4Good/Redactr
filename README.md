## Introduction

REDACTR is a web application designed to help users safely share content on social media platforms by scrambling specific words or phrases in their text. Whether you want to hide sensitive information, obscure profanity, or just have some fun, REDACTR makes it easy to redact text without the world knowing what's behind those asterisks.

With REDACTR, you can simply paste or type your text into a form field, specify the words you want to scramble, and let the app do the rest. After clicking the "Scramble Text" button, the app scans through the original text, identifying the specified words, and replaces them with asterisks (e.g., "bang" becomes "****").

## Features

- Redact specific words or phrases in a body of text.
- User-friendly web interface for easy interaction.
- Replace redacted words with customizable characters, including asterisks, question marks, dashes, underscores, or even other words (optional).
- Display statistics such as the number of words scanned, the number of matched words redacted, total characters redacted, and the time taken to complete the task.

## Usage

1. Visit the REDACTR website (link here).

2. Enter or paste the text you want to redact into the provided form field.

3. Specify the words or phrases you want to redact, separated by spaces.

4. (Optional) Choose the character(s) to replace redacted words with.

5. Click the "Redact Now" button to process the text.

6. The redacted text will be displayed, and you can easily copy it for sharing on social media.

## Advanced Features

- **Custom Replacement Characters:** Allow the user to specify custom characters for redaction, such as question marks, dashes, underscores, or even replacement words.

- **Statistics:** Display statistics about the redaction process, including the number of words scanned, the number of matched words redacted, the total characters redacted, and the time taken to complete the task.
